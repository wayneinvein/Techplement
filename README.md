This Java program, QuizApp, is a simple console-based quiz application. It allows users to create and take quizzes interactively. The QuizApp class uses a Map to store quizzes, with each quiz name mapped to a list of Question objects. In the main method, users can choose to either create a quiz, take an existing quiz, or exit the program. In quiz creation, users input a quiz name and enter multiple-choice questions, specifying options and the correct answer. When taking a quiz, users select from available quizzes, answer each question, and receive feedback for correct or incorrect responses. At the end, a score is displayed based on correct answers. The Question class encapsulates each question's text, options, and correct answer index, providing easy access through getter methods.
